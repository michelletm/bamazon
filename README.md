# bamazon

This project creates an app that views, alters, and appends a database of products via a query launched in the terminal, or node module. Tools used are VS Code, MySql Workbench, along with with MySql and Chalk node package managers. The project is useful as it requires the developer to work in javascript and MySql, and grasp a firm understanding of how the two can be connected. Users can get started with the project by creating a [database](bamazonCust.sql), as well as a variety of queries for it.

This project has two parts. [Challenge #1: Customer](bamazonCustomer.js) handles inputs and queries from a typical customer, purchase and stock info, and returns answers according to the data found on the database. [Challenge #2: Manager](bamazonManager.js) allows a more adminstrative view of the database, allowing a more detailed view of each items elements, as well as the capability to increase stock and add new items altogether.
